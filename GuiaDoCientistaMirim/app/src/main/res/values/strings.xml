    <string name="exp1">The oil is less dense than water and insoluble in it, so he is on it, forming stages. When added to aspirin, it reacts with water and forms included in the products of this reaction, carbon dioxide. This, which forms bubbles to be less than water and oil, finishes rising, this fantastically generating effervescent effect.</string>

    <string name="exp2">Among the zinc and copper there is what is called potential difference, where the first electrical charge tends to lose (oxidize) and the second receiving electrical load (reducing). But such transmission so that there is a means suitable loads is required electrical conductivity, which is provided by the salts dissolved in the water in the potato. Thus, potatoes associated with zinc and copper act as a battery that can be planted in the yard.</string>
    <string name="exp3">The ferrofluid does not pass many metal pieces immersed in oil on the effect of a magnetic field. It induces every piece of metal to behave like a magnet, with a positive and negative pole orientation. As a positive atre negative and similar repel each other, they will organize the consistency and flow of oil creating this abiotic hedgehog.</string>
    <string name="exp4">When the magnet is associated with the stack, it starts to act as an extension of it, so it becomes the negative pole. Herein, when the wire touches the positive pole and the magnet, there is a current flow that interacts with the magnetic field of the magnet, generating movement. This movement lasts for a short time, because the wire to lose contact with the negative pole (magnet), but as soon as the slope again, the movement makes can commence.</string>
    <string name="exp5">The water electrolysis, consists in breaking the water molecule 2 hydrogen atoms and oxygen by the addition of electricity. But, that there is electrical conductivity in the aqueous medium is an ionic solution, this is added sodium bicarbonate. The hydrogen which is soon formed is in a gaseous state and be less dense than water rising ends and being released from the hose, forming bubbles on the detergent.</string>
